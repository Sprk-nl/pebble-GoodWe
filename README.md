# Pebble-GoodWe

A pebble app to read GoodWe mobile webpage to get solar data.


# 2DO:
- up & down arrows go back & forth the date, creating new cards/windows to display one day.
- Dynamic scaling of Y axis, adjusted to the highest value
- A config page to enter you GoodWe ID
- Instead of creating new cards/windows: moving through the X axis, zooming in&out


# Problems to overcome:
- How to erase the window and redraw new bars.
