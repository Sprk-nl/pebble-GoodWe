# Pebble-GoodWe

A pebble app to read GoodWe mobile webpage to get solar data.


# 2DO:
- A config page to enter you GoodWe ID, but that requires hosting a webservice.
- Find out if GoodWe hosts a json page with energy produced per day in kWh, for all days. (not only today)
- Rewrite the code in C
- Get some color in JS, if it's possible.
